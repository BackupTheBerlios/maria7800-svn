- Our Maria application is now a simple SDL test. This is ok.
  Next problem: Currently there's no real simple way of running
  the thing, except by installing it. Now...perhaps we can make
  some kind of runmaria script. However, this in turn requires
  MONO_PATH to be set. Can we extract that somehow from runtests.sh ?
  => Let's try...
  => Additionally, the tao directory needs to be added to MONO_PATH...
- Possibly we can work on the Cart classes.
  - I think I'll port the remaining carts and then
    worry about refactoring them.
- Build process:
  - At some point we should perhaps keep referenced assemblies
    as dependencies of the assembly that should be built.
  - Rundir has the MONO_PATH hardcoded, which is not terribly
    convenient. It should construct it itself from the src tree.
- Learn how to tag stuff, and tag the ORIGINAL emu7800 source code
  in the repository with 0.71 or somesuch.
- Raise warning level when compiling ?
- At some point search for \n sequences in source code and
  replace them by Environment.NewLine. Or so. Oh well.
---
Stuff to clean up:
- The whole Cart base/concrete class business looks a bit odd to me
- Duplicated code (offset calculation) in MD5.cs and GameSettings.cs
- Does GameSettings really need that many getters/setters ?
  (Nah. Probably it could happily be an immutable)
- Odd that AddressSpace owns a Machine reference, because it never uses it...
