- NEXT:
  Implement AddressSpace ctor, and test things as we go.
  An empty AddressSpaceTest#TestCreation() method exists
  already. Or so. Oh well. Don't care too much, really.
- Port AddressSpace class now. This involves:
  - Creating a dummy Machine class. This will work, since
    the AddressSpace just stores the reference, but never
    uses it (so it shouldn't have it at all, technically...)
  - The two Map methods can be unified, since the interface
    to support both of them is now unified in IDevice.
  - Perhaps the snooper thingy could be more bulletproof, or more versatile:
    - Either check wether already a snooper is set, and if so, throw (when setting it again)
    - Or allow N snoopers. Don't know wether this will be necessary, though.
- Learn how to tag stuff, and tag the ORIGINAL emu7800 source code
  in the repository with 0.71 or somesuch.
- Raise warning level when compiling ?
- We could also go and port the disassembler...the thing doesn't
  seem to use too much other stuff ?
  => nope...needs the AddressSpace and the Machine/CPU classes (?)
---
Stuff to clean up:
- Duplicated code (offset calculation) in MD5.cs and GameSettings.cs
- Does GameSettings really need that many getters/setters ?
  (Nah. Probably it could happily be an immutable)
