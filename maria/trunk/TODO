- Addressspace:
  - Finish
    - Implement Map (finish it), and test it.
      Need probably also ti work on read-indexer, because we need it to test mapping...
    - Test read/write/wraparound (implement/test indexers)
  - Are there places where ArgumentCheck might make sense ?
  - Should we try to detect cases where devices are mapped over eachother ???
    (We can detect them, and still stop doing so if we NEED to map devices over eachother)
    (Exception : mapping over (=replacing a NullDevice) is ok ?  
- Build process:
  - At some point we should perhaps keep referenced assemblies
    as dependencies of the assembly that should be built.
  - Rundir has the MONO_PATH hardcoded, which is not terribly
    convenient. It should construct it itself from the src tree.
- Learn how to tag stuff, and tag the ORIGINAL emu7800 source code
  in the repository with 0.71 or somesuch.
- Raise warning level when compiling ?
- We could also go and port the disassembler...the thing doesn't
  seem to use too much other stuff ?
  => nope...needs the AddressSpace and the Machine/CPU classes (?)
---
Stuff to clean up:
- Duplicated code (offset calculation) in MD5.cs and GameSettings.cs
- Does GameSettings really need that many getters/setters ?
  (Nah. Probably it could happily be an immutable)
- Odd that AddressSpace owns a Machine reference, because it never uses it...
