- Learn how to tag stuff, and tag the ORIGINAL emu7800 source code
  in the repository with 0.71 or somesuch.
- Raise warning level when compiling ?
- Well...I'd say we port the GameSettings class now. This involves creating
  a bunch of enumerations up front, which isn't a big problem in my opinion.
  Do the attributes in the GameSettings class really need to be all public,
  btw ???
- Is it possible to disable array range checks ? Would probably speed up
  many things, for instance simulated RAM access...
- Port AddressSpace class (involves introducing a dummy machine class...)
- We could also go and port the disassembler...the thing doesn't
  seem to use too much other stuff ?
  => nope...needs the AddressSpace class
- The AddressSpace class can't be too hard to port actually,
  even if the Machine class is still missing: AddressSpace just
  stores a Machine reference, but never uses it itself...silly,
  isn't it ?
- We have now IDevice - which means we can port a bunch of devices =)
  Pick another device and "port" it.
