- REALLY learn how to use svn. Involves probably working through
  large parts of the starter kit book on svn. Whatever.
  It's certainly worth it.
- Try out SVN access at BerliOS. If it is any good:
  - Import the stuff we have by now to BerliOS
    (also a complete copy of the original emu7800 0.71 source)
  - Change all email addresses in the code from tom42@sourceforge.net
    tom42@users.berlios.de
- Raise warning level when compiling ?
- Well...I'd say we port the GameSettings class now. This involves creating
  a bunch of enumerations up front, which isn't a big problem in my opinion.
  Do the attributes in the GameSettings class really need to be all public,
  btw ???
- Port AddressSpace class (involves introducing a dummy machine class...)
- We could also go and port the disassembler...the thing doesn't
  seem to use too much other stuff ?
  => nope...needs the AddressSpace class
- The AddressSpace class can't be too hard to port actually,
  even if the Machine class is still missing: AddressSpace just
  stores a Machine reference, but never uses it itself...silly,
  isn't it ?
- We have now IDevice - which means we can port a bunch of devices =)
  Pick another device and "port" it.
