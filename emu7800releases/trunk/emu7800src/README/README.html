		<h2 id="introduction">1.0 Introduction</h2>
		This is a release of EMU7800, an Atari 7800 emulator implemented using Microsoft's .NET platform.
		Most VCS (2600) and ProSystem (7800) titles work well, with 2600 
		support featuring authentic HMOVE emulation, per Andrew Tower's paper &quot;A 
		Small Opus on the TIA.&quot; The stars in Cosmic Ark appear, but without emulation cheats.
		<p />
		EMU7800 runs on Windows 2000, XP, and later systems. 
		Performance is excellent on systems a year or less old.
		<p />
		EMU7800 was originally an academic graduate capstone project for the <a href="http://www.tacoma.washington.edu/tech">
			Institute of Technology</a> at <a href="http://www.tacoma.washington.edu/">UW Tacoma</a>.
		<p />
		Send me a note if you have questions or feedback. Enjoy!

		<h2 id="installation">2.0 Installation</h2>
		
		<h3 id="prerequisites">2.1 Prerequisites</h3>
		To run EMU7800, you will need to have the .NET 2.0 runtime installed onto your Windows-based computer.
		You can do this via <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">Windows Update</a>.
		To have the capability to build from the included source code,
		you'll either need the .NET 2.0 software development kit (SDK) or Visual Studio 2005.
		Free versions of each are available on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)</a> site.
		EMU7800 was developed on a machine with a Pentium 4 Celeron 1.7 GHZ processor (four year-old system, as of this writing.)
		This appears adequate for emulator performance.
		
		<h3 id="msi">2.2 Installing the Distribution</h3>
		The distribution is made available as an Windows Installer <tt>.MSI</tt> file. 
		Simply launch it to deploy the software to your machine.
		A single shortcut will be placed on your desktop to launch the emulator.
		
		<h3 id="rebuilding">2.3 Rebuilding from Source</h3>
		For the curious, the complete source code is included in the distribution and is located
		in the <tt>src/</tt> folder.
		To rebuild from source, either use Visual Studio 2005 to open the <tt>*.sln</tt>
		or use the following MSBuild command in a CMD.EXE window:
		<p />
		<tt>MSBuild /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release EMU7800.csproj</tt>
		<p />
		<h4 id="romproperties">2.4 Game Cartridge Information Database (a.k.a. ROMProperties)</h4>
		In EMU7800, recognized game ROM files have associated properties that determine the proper execution configuration of the emulator.
		These attributes are stored in the <tt>ROMProperties.CSV</tt> file, located in the same directory as the executable.
		Any editor that can work with <tt>.CSV</tt> files (e.g. NOTEPAD.EXE and Excel&trade;), can be used to update the file.
		Note that a copy of this file is also in the <tt>src\</tt> folder&mdash;serving as a ready backup if necessary.

		<h3 id="gamecontrollersjoysticks">3.2 Game Controller/Joysticks</h3>
		Up to two game controllers (e.g. joysticks) can be used, where the first two found in the device list will be selected for use.
		<p />
		For game ROMs that use the paddle controller, the mouse will be used as input unless 
		the <a href="http://www.atariage.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=267">Stelladaptor</a>
		controller is detected as one of the selected game controllers.
		In this case, mouse input is deactivated and the <a href="http://www.atariage.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=267">Stelladaptor</a> 
		device is used instead for paddle input.
		<p />
		Mouse input can be disabled manually via the Console tab (enter <tt>?</tt> for a list of available commands) should your system
		suppress the Stelladaptor device name from EMU7800.
		<p />
		The paddle swapping keys (<tt>Q</tt> and <tt>E</tt>) of the SDL Host are useful when you are using a set of original Atari
		paddles, where the &quot;player 1&quot; potentiometer is excessively worn and delivers non-uniform and/or erratic resistances.
		Chances are the &quot;player 2&quot; dial has not seen as much action, and will perform much better.
			
		<h3 id="paddleandlightgunemu">3.3 Paddle and Lightgun Emulation via Mouse (SDL Host only)</h3>
		On paddle games, the mouse can be used as the paddle controller.
		Sensitivity is currently not configurable.
		The mouse is also be used for lightgun games. 
		Look for a small white dot that indicates where on the screen the &quot;lightgun&quot; is pointed at.

		The number of ROMs recognized in the <tt>roms/</tt> directory is displayed in the lower left corner.
		To select a new directory, click the Select ROM File button, and navigate to the ROM directory of your choice.

		<h4 id="settingstab">3.4.2 Settings Tab</h4>
		<p />
		<img src="EMU7800Settings.JPG" alt="Settings Tab"/>
		<p />
		There are several settings that can be adjusted on this tab.
		Settings will saved, so they will not need to be set again every time the program is launched.
		<p />
		<ul>
			<li>		
		    <b>Host Select</b>: There are two &quot;hosts&quot; available to run the emulated machinery.
		    One is &quot;Windows GDI (GDI Host)&quot; and the other is &quot;Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL Host).&quot;
		    The GDI Host is not the better of the two for game playing, but is good for emulator development and testing.
		    It does not operate in full-screen mode, and not all controller features are supported.
		    Further, video performance degrades proportional to the amount of differences between frames.
			For the best game-playing experience, choose the SDL Host.<p /></li>
			<li>
			<b>Frame Rate Adjust</b>: Default framerate for NTSC (N. American T.V. standard) games is 60HZ, while the default 
			framerate for PAL (European T.V. standard) games is 50HZ. Should you find that your computer is not fast 
			enough to run the emulator, you can adjust the framerate down as appropriate. 
			Persistant audio popping indicates the sound queue is underflowing&mdash;indicating 
			the emulator is unable to run fast enough to keep it filled. Note that reducing 
			the framerate also scales down the audio playback frequency accordingly, so the 
			audio pitch will decrease.
			Audio playback is used to throttle the display framerate&mdash;so both are tightly coupled.<p /></li>
			<li>
			<b>Sound Queue Length</b>: Reducing the queue length reduces the sound latency, but increases the risk of 
			the sound queue underflowing. Correspondingly, increasing the queue length 
			increases the sound latency, but decreases the risk of the sound queue 
			underflowing.  In many cases, this will not need to be adjusted.<p /></li>
			<li>
			<b>Sound Volume</b>: Adjusts the sound volume.  In many cases, this will not need to be adjusted as
			the volume knob on your PC speakers may work just as well.<p /></li>
			<li>
			<b>Skip BIOS (7800 Emulation)</b>: The real Atari 7800 executes BIOS code on machine startup.
			To do this on the emulator, the BIOS ROM(s) (one for NTSC, and one for PAL) need 
			to be in the current ROM directory and this checkbox needs to be unchecked.
			If you do not have the BIOS files or just want to skip BIOS execution, check this box.<p /></li>
			<li>
			<b>Use 7800 High Score Cart (7800 Emulation)</b>: For the 7800, there was a cartridge 
			that provided a facility for 7800 games to save high score information.
			Not all games, however, took advantage of this.
			Set this checkbox to simulate this device&mdash;you will also need the associated ROM for this feature to work. 
			EMU7800 will detect the ROM regardless of filename, as long as it is in the current ROM directory.<p /></li>

		Events pertinate to the execution of the emulator are logged to the Console.
		Commands may also be issued here to access features not available via the GUI.
		To see what is available, enter <tt>?</tt>.
		
		<h4 id="helptab">3.4.4 Help Tab</h4>

		<p />
		The Help tab features an integrated web browser control.
		Two link controls are available, located at the bottom of the control.
		The README link references this README file on the local system.
		The Game Help link varies dependent upon the currently selected game,
		and is intended to reference original game instruction manuals, available online.
		At the time of this writing, not all games have help URLs defined.
		URLs can be specified in the <tt>ROMProperties.csv</tt> file, and more will be included in subsequent EMU7800 verisons.
		Standard web browser features, like the Back button and Refresh, are available by right-clicking in the browser window.
		<p />
		Note that when the Game Help link is clicked, it will &quot;disable&quot; to indicate the page is loading.
		It will &quot;re-enable&quot; once loading is complete.
		If no Game Help URL is available, the link will not be visible.

		<h3 id="tuning">3.5 Addressing Performance Problems</h3>
		In essence, EMU7800 is a streaming media application.
		Video output is a sequence of pixels emulating the television raster beam sweeping across the 
		inside surface of the television screen.
		Similarly, audio output is a stream of pulses.
		The emulator operates by running as fast as possible, working to fill up the sound queue.
		Once full, the emulator waits on the queue until a sound frame opens up to receive the next frame of data.
		The sound queue is consumed by the audio device, at the suitable playback speed.
		This has the effect of opening up sound frames precisely at the desired frame rate
		and ultimately synchronizing the video and audio output together.
		<p />
		Should the sound queue be consumed at a faster rate than it can be filled,
		annoying popping or buzzing noises will occur.
		The <a href="#settingstab">Settings Tab</a> permit the frame rate to be throttled up or down from the default.
		Reducing the frame rate will reduce the rate at which the sound queue is consumed,
		giving the emulator a better chance of keeping up.
		
		<h3 id="commandline">3.6 External Command-line Options</h3>
		To support various emulator front-end programs, EMU7800 can be launched with a 
		full filename provided as a command-line argument:<br />
		<br />
		<tt>EMU7800.exe &quot;c:\Program Files\EMU7800\roms\OYSTR29.BIN&quot;</tt><br />
		<br />
		Should the ROM file not be found, be unreadable, or not recognized, the GUI 
		interface will be launched as normal.
		Clicking on the Console Tab will show the reason for the failure.
		Otherwise, the ROM will be run immediately.
